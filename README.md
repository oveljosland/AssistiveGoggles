# AssistiveGoggles
This repository contains the code for the Assistive Goggles project. 

The project is a wearable device that helps visually impaired people navigate their surroundings. 
The device uses a camera to capture images of the user's surroundings, and then processes the images to identify objects and obstacles. The device then provides audio feedback to the user to help them navigate safely.
In addition to object detection, the project also includes a module for text recognition, which can help the user read signs and other text in their environment.

## Running the code
To run the code, you will need a Raspberry Pi, an Intel RealSense D400 series camera, a set of ultrasonic sensors and a pair of headphones and vibration motors for sensory feedback.

There is also a couple other requirements that is needed for the code to run properly.
- A Raspberry capable of USB 3.0
- Intel librealsense2 installed on the Raspberry Pi
- OpenCV installed on the Raspberry Pi
